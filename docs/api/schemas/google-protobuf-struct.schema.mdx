`Struct` represents a structured data value, consisting of fields
 which map to dynamically typed values. In some languages, `Struct`
 might be supported by a native representation. For example, in
 scripting languages like JS a struct is represented as an
 object. The details of that representation are described together
 with the proto support for the language.

 The JSON representation for `Struct` is JSON object.
