This page allows you to configure the Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers used by the OtterScale system for time synchronization. Accurate timekeeping is crucial for distributed systems and log consistency.

## Overview

The NTP Server settings page displays the currently configured NTP server addresses. Each server is shown with a clock icon.

## Why is NTP Important?

NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network. In a cluster environment like OtterScale, it serves several critical functions:

- **Log Analysis**: Synchronized time is essential for correlating logs across different servers to debug issues effectively.
- **Distributed Consistency**: Distributed systems (e.g., databases, consensus algorithms) rely on accurate time to maintain data integrity and order of operations.
- **Security**: Many security protocols (like TLS/SSL certificates and Kerberos) rely on time validation. Significant time drift can cause authentication failures.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Ensures that automated tasks and backups run at the correct coordinated times.

## Edit NTP Servers

To modify the NTP server list, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1.  Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) located at the top right of the configuration section.

2.  A modal window titled "Edit NTP Server" will appear.

3.  In the **Address** field, you can manage the list of NTP servers:

    - **Add a server:** Type the NTP server address (e.g., `pool.ntp.org`) in the input field and click the **Add** button (or press Enter).
    - **Remove a server:** Click the remove icon next to an existing address to delete it.
    - **Clear all:** Use the **Clear** button to remove all entries.

4.  Click **Confirm** to save your changes. The system will update the configuration and the new list will be displayed.
