This page allows you to configure the Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers used by the OtterScale system for time synchronization. Accurate timekeeping is crucial for distributed systems and log consistency.

## Introduction

The NTP Server configuration page allows you to manage the time synchronization sources for your OtterScale infrastructure. Here you can view and modify the list of NTP servers that will be used across all scopes.

**Key Points:**

- **Scope:** These settings apply to all scopes. Any changes made here will affect time synchronization for MAAS itself, all deployed machines, and devices using MAAS's DHCP services.
- **Default Configuration:** By default, OtterScale uses `ntp.ubuntu.com` as the NTP server.
- **Address Format:** You can specify NTP servers using either IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) or hostnames (e.g., `pool.ntp.org`, `time.google.com`).
- **Multiple Servers:** It's recommended to configure multiple NTP servers for redundancy. If one server becomes unavailable, the system will automatically fall back to alternative servers.
- **Display:** Each configured server is displayed with a clock icon in the configuration list.

## Why is NTP Important?

NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network. In a cluster environment like OtterScale, it serves several critical functions:

- **Log Analysis**: Synchronized time is essential for correlating logs across different servers to debug issues effectively.
- **Distributed Consistency**: Distributed systems (e.g., databases, consensus algorithms) rely on accurate time to maintain data integrity and order of operations.
- **Security**: Many security protocols (like TLS/SSL certificates and Kerberos) rely on time validation. Significant time drift can cause authentication failures.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Ensures that automated tasks and backups run at the correct coordinated times.

## Edit NTP Servers

To modify the NTP server list, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1.  Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) located at the top right of the configuration section.

2.  A modal window titled "Edit NTP Server" will appear.

3.  In the **Address** field, you can manage the list of NTP servers:

    - **Add a server:** Type the NTP server address (e.g., `pool.ntp.org`) in the input field and click the **+** button to add it to the list (or press Enter).
    - **Remove a server:** Click the **×** icon next to an existing address to delete it from the list.

4.  Click **Confirm** to save your changes. The system will update the configuration and the new list will be displayed.
