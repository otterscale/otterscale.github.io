This page allows you to manage the operating system images (Boot Images) available for provisioning machines in the OtterScale cluster. These images are typically Ubuntu LTS releases.

## Overview

The Boot Image settings page displays a list of configured boot images. The table includes the following information:

- **Name**: The display name of the operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
- **Source**: The URL of the image repository.
- **Distro Series**: The codename of the distribution release (e.g., `jammy`, `noble`).
- **Default**: Indicates if this is the default image used when no specific image is requested.
- **Architecture**: The CPU architectures supported by this image (e.g., `amd64`, `arm64`).
- **Status**: Shows the sync status of the image architectures.

## Manage Boot Images

You can perform the following actions to manage boot images:

### Create a New Boot Image

To add a new boot image configuration:

<Steps>

1.  Click the **Create** button (plus icon) at the top of the page.

2.  A modal window titled "Create Boot Image" will appear.

3.  **Select Distro Series**: Choose the desired Ubuntu release from the dropdown menu.

4.  **Select Architecture**: Choose one or more CPU architectures to support for this release.

5.  Click **Confirm** to save. The system will begin tracking this image configuration.

</Steps>

### Import Images

To synchronize the local image cache with the upstream source:

1.  Click the **Import** button (refresh icon).
2.  The system will trigger a background process to download and update the images. The button will show an "Importing..." state with a spinner while the process is running.
