This page allows you to manage tags that can be assigned to machines in the OtterScale cluster. Tags are useful for grouping machines, applying specific configurations, or identifying machine roles (e.g., `kubernetes-worker`, `ceph-osd`).

## Overview

The Machine Tag settings page displays a list of all existing tags. The table includes the following information:

- **Tag**: The name of the tag (e.g., `gpu`, `storage`).
- **Comment**: A description or note associated with the tag. Built-in tags may have specific comments indicating their purpose.
