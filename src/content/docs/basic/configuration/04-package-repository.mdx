This page allows you to manage the package repositories used by the machines in the OtterScale cluster. These repositories are the sources from which software packages and updates are downloaded (e.g., the Ubuntu archive).

## Overview

The Package Repository settings page displays a list of configured repositories. The table includes the following information:

- **Name**: The name of the repository (e.g., `Ubuntu archive`).
- **URL**: The base URL of the repository.
- **Enabled**: Indicates whether the repository is currently active and being used.
