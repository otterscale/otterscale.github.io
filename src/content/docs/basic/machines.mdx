The Machines section allows you to manage the **physical machines** (bare metal) in your infrastructure. The list of machines is retrieved directly from MAAS.

<Aside type="note">
	Any machine detected by MAAS will automatically appear in this list. MAAS detects new machines
	when they PXE boot on the network (a process known as **Enlistment**). Once enlisted, they are
	available for commissioning and deployment.
</Aside>

## Introduction

The Machines page displays a comprehensive list of all machines in your scope, along with real-time statistics and management tools.

### Statistics Overview

At the top of the page, you will find a dashboard summarizing the state of your infrastructure based on the current filters:

		Total number of machines currently listed.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Power" icon="sourcehut">
		The percentage and count of machines that are currently powered on.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Deployments" icon="seti:plan">
		The percentage and count of machines that are successfully deployed.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Disk" icon="seti:db">
		The total number of physical disks and the aggregate storage capacity across all listed
		machines.

## Manage Machine

You can perform management actions on individual machines using the action menu or specific buttons.

### Power Off

Turns off the machine.
This action is only available when the machine is currently powered on.

<Aside type="caution" title="Requirement">
	You must type the machine's FQDN to confirm the action.
</Aside>

### Remove

Permanently removes the machine from the system.

<Aside type="danger" title="Requirement">
	You must type the machine's FQDN to confirm deletion.
</Aside>

- **Options**:
  - **Force**: Force removal even if the machine is not in a valid state.
  - **Purge Disk**: Securely erase the disk contents during removal.

### Adding to Scope

To add a machine to a specific scope:

<Steps>

1. Navigate to `https://<your-url>/scope/<scope-name>/setup`.
2. Click the **Add Node** button.
3. Select the machine that has not yet been registered to a scope to add it.

</Steps>
