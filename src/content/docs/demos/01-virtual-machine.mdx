This guide demonstrates how to create and provision a Virtual Machine (VM) within the OtterScale cluster for running workloads.

## Create a Virtual Machine

<Aside type="tip">
Virtual Machines allow you to provision compute instances within your OtterScale cluster. You can configure hardware profiles, attach storage volumes, and customize network ports to meet your specific needs.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the Compute section:

   Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   <url>/scope/<scope-name>/compute
   ```

2. Create a new Virtual Machine:

   - Click the **Create** button (plus icon) at the top of the Compute page
   - A modal window titled "Create Virtual Machine" will appear

3. Configure Basic Settings:

   - **Name**: Enter a unique name for the VM (e.g., `my-demo-vm`)
   - **Namespace**: Specify the Kubernetes namespace (defaults to `default`)
   - **Instance Type**: Select a hardware profile from the dropdown list (displays CPU cores and Memory size)
   - **Data Volume**: Select the bootable Data Volume (PVC) to use as the OS disk

4. Configure Advanced Settings (Optional):

   - Expand the "Advanced" section to configure a **Startup Script** (Cloud-Init user data)
   - This allows you to bootstrap the instance with custom initialization commands
   - Example configuration for user setup and SSH access:

   ```
   #cloud-config
   users:
     - name: phison
       sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
       groups: sudo
       shell: /bin/bash
   chpasswd:
     list: |
       phison:phison_8299
     expire: false
   ssh_pwauth: true
   ```

5. Review and Confirm:

   - Review all the configuration settings
   - Click **Confirm** to launch the Virtual Machine

6. Wait for VM Initialization:

   - The VM will begin provisioning and cloning a Data Volume for its use
   - Monitor the **Status** column to track the initialization progress
   - Wait until the status changes to **Running**

</Steps>

## Monitor the Virtual Machine

Once the VM is created, you can monitor its status in the Compute page:

<Steps>

1. View the VM in the Compute list:

   - Locate your newly created VM by name in the table
   - Check the **Status** column to see the current state (e.g., Running, Stopped)

2. Access VM resources:

   - **Machine**: Click to view which physical node is hosting your VM
   - **Disk**: Expand to view and manage attached storage volumes
   - **Ports**: Expand to view and manage network port configurations
   - **Metrics**: Monitor real-time CPU, Memory, and Storage usage
   - **VNC**: Access the VM console directly through VNC

</Steps>

## Configure Service for VM Access

To enable external access to your Virtual Machine, configure a service to expose its ports:

<Steps>

1. Add a service port for SSH access:

   - In the Compute page, locate your VM in the table
   - Click on the **Ports** column to expand the port management section
   - Click **Add Port** to create a new service port
   - Configure the port settings:
     - **Protocol**: `tcp`
     - **Port**: `22` (SSH service port on the VM)
     - **NodePort**: (leave empty for automatic assignment or specify a fixed port)
   - The system will automatically assign a NodePort (e.g., `30022`) for external access

2. Note the NodePort:

   - Record the assigned NodePort from the Ports section
   - This is the port you'll use to connect to the VM from outside the cluster

</Steps>

## Access Your Virtual Machine

Once the VM is running, fully initialized, and the service port is configured:

<Steps>

1. Wait for cloud-init initialization:

   - The VM will automatically execute the cloud-init configuration
   - The system user `phison` will be created with sudo privileges
   - The password will be set as configured in the cloud-config

2. Connect to the VM:

   - Use SSH to connect to your VM from external hosts
   - Connection example:
     ```
     ssh -p <NodePort> phison@<cluster-host>
     ```
   - Or use VNC to connect directly through the web interface
   - Login credentials:
     - **Username**: `phison`
     - **Password**: `phison_8299`

3. Start using your VM:

   - You now have full access to configure and use the Virtual Machine
   - The user has sudo privileges for system administration tasks

</Steps>
