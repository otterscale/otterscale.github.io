This guide demonstrates how to deploy Coder to provide cloud-based VS Code IDE environments for development and coding.

## Deploy Coder

<Aside type="tip">
Coder provides a cloud-based VS Code IDE that can be accessed through a web browser. It supports multiple backend options including Go and Python versions, making it suitable for various development workflows.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the Applications Store:

   Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   <url>/scope/<scope-name>/applications/store
   ```

2. Search and install Coder:

   - Search for `code-server` (available versions: `code-server-go` or `code-server-python`)
   - Choose your preferred version (Go for better performance, Python for flexibility)
   - Click on the Coder card
   - Click the **Install** button and follow the installation wizard
   - Review and confirm the Helm Chart configuration

3. Verify the deployment:

   Go to the Workloads page:
   ```
   <url>/scope/<scope-name>/applications/workloads
   ```
   
   - Use the **Namespace** filter to find the deployment
   - Search for `coder` or `code-server` to locate the deployed Coder workload
   - Verify that the workload status shows as running

4. Access Coder VS Code IDE:

   - In the Workloads list, locate the Coder workload
   - Click on the **NodePort** link to open VS Code in your browser
   
   <Aside type="tip" title="Default Credentials">
   Access the VS Code IDE directly through the NodePort link. Once opened, you can start coding immediately. Authentication and access control are managed through the application deployment settings.
   </Aside>

</Steps>

## Initial Setup

Once Coder is deployed and running:

1. Access the VS Code IDE through the NodePort link in your browser
2. You'll see the VS Code interface with a file explorer and terminal
3. Start creating or editing files directly in the browser-based editor
4. Use the integrated terminal for running commands and development tasks
