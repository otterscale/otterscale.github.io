This guide demonstrates how to deploy JupyterHub to provide collaborative Jupyter notebook environments for multiple users.

## Deploy JupyterHub

<Aside type="tip">
JupyterHub provides a multi-user environment where multiple users can access Jupyter notebooks simultaneously, making it ideal for collaborative data science and educational purposes.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the Applications Store:

   Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   <url>/scope/<scope-name>/applications/store
   ```

2. Search and install JupyterHub:

   - Search for `jupyterhub`
   - Click on the JupyterHub card
   - Click the **Install** button and follow the installation wizard
   - Review and confirm the Helm Chart configuration

3. Verify the deployment:

   Go to the Workloads page:
   ```
   <url>/scope/<scope-name>/applications/workloads
   ```
   
   - Use the **Namespace** filter to find the deployment
   - Search for `jupyterhub` to locate the deployed JupyterHub workload
   - Verify that the workload status shows as running

4. Access JupyterHub:

   - In the same Workloads list, locate the workload named **proxy**
   - Click on the **NodePort** link to open JupyterHub in your browser
   
   <Aside type="tip" title="Default Credentials">
   The default login credentials are:
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `admin`
   
   For production environments, it's highly recommended to change these credentials through JupyterHub administration settings.
   </Aside>

</Steps>

## Initial Setup

Once JupyterHub is deployed and running:

1. Access the JupyterHub login page
2. Create or log in with your credentials
3. Start a new notebook server
4. Begin using Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and development
