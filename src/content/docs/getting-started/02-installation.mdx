This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step process for installing OtterScale on your Control Node. Ensure you have completed all prerequisites outlined in the Prerequisites section before proceeding. The installation involves setting up dependencies, configuring the environment, and deploying the system.

<Aside>
	All commands should be run on the designated OtterScale Control Node with sudo privileges where required.

<Steps>

1.  ### **Install Required Packages and Docker**

    Install essential tools and Docker, which are needed for cloning the repository and running containerized services.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y git curl
    sudo snap install docker
    ```

2.  ### **Clone the OtterScale Repository**

    Download the OtterScale source code from GitHub.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/otterscale/otterscale.git
    ```

3.  ### **Configure the Environment File**

    Navigate to the cloned directory and set up the environment configuration.

    ```bash
    cd otterscale
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file to update the following variables:
    - `APP_VERSION`: Set to the desired version (e.g., `0.6.0`).
    - `PUBLIC_API_URL`: Set to your Control Node's IP address and port (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8299`). Replace `xx.xx.xx.xx` with your actual IP.

    You can edit the file using a text editor like `nano`:

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

4.  ### **Start OtterScale Services**

    Launch the necessary services in the background using Docker Compose.

    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose up -d
    ```

    Verify that the services are running:

    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose ps
    ```

5.  ### **Execute the Installation Script**

    Complete the installation via the web interface.

    1. Open your web browser and access the OtterScale UI at the `PUBLIC_API_URL` you configured (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8299`).
    2. In the UI, locate and copy the installation CLI command.
    3. Paste and run the command in your terminal with sudo privileges.

    If you encounter any issues during execution, first verify your Firewall Configuration as outlined in the Prerequisites section. Additionally, check the `setup.log` file in the current directory for detailed error information.

</Steps>

	Upon successful completion, your OtterScale system will be operational. Proceed to the next guide for configuration and usage.
