OtterScale is a unified infrastructure management platform designed to simplify the deployment and operation of complex distributed systems. It integrates bare metal provisioning, container orchestration, and distributed storage into a single, cohesive interface.

## System Architecture

OtterScale is built on a layered architecture that provides complete control from the hardware up to the application layer.

### Core Layers

1.  **Hardware Layer**: Manages physical resources including Compute nodes, Storage nodes, and GPU accelerators.
2.  **Provisioning Layer (MAAS)**: Handles bare metal provisioning, OS deployment, and network configuration.
3.  **Orchestration Layer (Juju & Kubernetes)**: Manages application lifecycles and container orchestration.
4.  **Storage Layer (Ceph)**: Provides scalable, distributed storage for the cluster.

### Node Provisioning & Management

OtterScale automates the lifecycle of physical nodes. Through the integration with MAAS, it handles power management (IPMI/Redfish), PXE booting, and OS installation.

### Storage Topology

The platform utilizes Ceph to provide a robust, self-healing storage fabric. Storage nodes are dedicated to managing data replication and distribution, ensuring high availability and performance for data-intensive workloads like AI model training.

## Key Features

- **Scope Management**: logically isolate resources and manage access control for different teams or projects.
- **AI/LLM Readiness**: Optimized for high-performance computing with support for GPU acceleration and high-speed networking (InfiniBand/RoCE).
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Securely share infrastructure across multiple users while maintaining resource isolation.
- **Unified Interface**: A single pane of glass for monitoring and managing the entire stack, from metal to service.
