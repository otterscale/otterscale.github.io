		<strong class="text-xl">OtterScale</strong> is a{' '}
		<strong class="text-xl">Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI)</strong>
		platform that unifies compute, storage, networking, and virtualization into a single, software-defined

<Aside type="tip">
	OtterScale is purpose-built for high-performance computing, offering robust **computation**
	capabilities with GPU acceleration, scalable **storage**, and efficient **cluster** management,
	making it an ideal foundation for AI/LLM/Data Center workloads.
</Aside>

## System Architecture

OtterScale is built on a layered architecture that provides complete control from the hardware up to the application layer.

### Core Layers

<Steps>

1.  **Hardware Layer**: Manages physical resources including Compute nodes, Storage nodes, and GPU accelerators.
2.  **Provisioning Layer (MAAS)**: Handles bare metal provisioning, OS deployment, and network configuration.
3.  **Orchestration Layer (Juju & Kubernetes)**: Manages application lifecycles and container orchestration.
4.  **Storage Layer (Ceph)**: Provides scalable, distributed storage for the cluster.

</Steps>

### Node Provisioning & Management

OtterScale automates the lifecycle of physical nodes. Through the integration with MAAS, it handles power management (IPMI/Redfish), PXE booting, and OS installation.

### Storage Topology

The platform utilizes Ceph to provide a robust, self-healing storage fabric. Storage nodes are dedicated to managing data replication and distribution, ensuring high availability and performance for data-intensive workloads like AI model training.
