## Manage Workloads

You can manage the lifecycle of your applications using the **Actions** menu.

### Workload Actions

The **Actions** menu (three dots icon) for each application provides the following options:

#### Restart

Triggers a rolling restart of the application. This is useful for reloading configurations or clearing transient issues.

<Steps>

1.  Select **Restart** from the actions menu.
2.  Confirm the action to initiate the restart process.

</Steps>

#### Scale

Allows you to adjust the number of replicas for the application.

<Aside type="note">
	Scaling is available for `Deployment` and `StatefulSet` types. `DaemonSet` scaling is managed by
	the number of eligible nodes in the cluster.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1.  Select **Scale** from the actions menu.
2.  Enter the desired number of replicas.
3.  Click **Confirm** to update the application scale.

</Steps>
