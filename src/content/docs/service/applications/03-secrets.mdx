The Secrets page allows you to view and manage Kubernetes Secrets within your OtterScale cluster. Secrets are used to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys, keeping them separate from your application code.

## Introduction

The Secrets page displays a list of all secrets in the selected namespace. The table includes the following information:

| Column         | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**       | The name of the secret. **Clickable**: Clicking the name opens a dialog where you can view the decoded key-value pairs stored in the secret. |
| **Namespace**  | The Kubernetes namespace where the secret is stored.                                                                                         |
| **Type**       | The type of the secret (e.g., `Opaque`, `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`), which defines how the data is used.                          |
| **Immutable**  | Indicates whether the secret's data can be changed. A checkmark means it is immutable (read-only), while a cross means it can be modified.   |
| **Labels**     | Key-value pairs attached to the secret for organization and selection.                                                                       |
| **Created At** | The time elapsed since the secret was created. Hovering over the time displays the exact creation timestamp.                                 |

## View Secret Details

To view the sensitive data stored within a secret:

<Steps>

1.  Click on the **Name** of the secret in the table.
2.  A dialog window will appear, listing all keys contained in the secret.
3.  The values are automatically decoded (from Base64) and displayed.
4.  Use the **Copy** button next to a value to copy it to your clipboard.

</Steps>

## Manage Secrets

Currently, the Secrets page provides a secure way to view and audit existing secrets. Creation and management of secrets are typically handled through your deployment workflows, CLI tools, or external secret management systems.
