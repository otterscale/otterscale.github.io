The Store page serves as a marketplace for discovering and deploying applications to your OtterScale cluster. It leverages Helm charts to package and manage applications, providing a user-friendly interface to browse, install, and manage releases.

## Introduction

The Store page displays a catalog of available applications (Helm charts). You can browse the catalog using filters for name, keyword, maintainer, and deprecation status.

Each application card displays:

- **Icon**: The application's logo.
- **Name**: The name of the application.
- **Version**: The current version of the chart.
- **Description**: A brief description of the application.
- **Repository**: The source repository of the chart (e.g., `otterscale/`). Official OtterScale charts are marked with a "Official" badge.

## Managing the Catalog

The Store provides tools to keep your application catalog up-to-date and flexible. You can find the **Import** and **Sync** buttons at the top right of the page.

### Synchronize with ArtifactHub

To populate the store with popular community applications, use the **Sync** feature.

- Clicking the **Sync** button initiates a synchronization process with [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/).
- The system automatically fetches the **top 60 most popular Helm charts** based on ArtifactHub rankings.
- This ensures your cluster has quick access to widely used tools (such as Argo CD, Prometheus, or Airflow) without manual configuration.

### Import Custom Charts

If you need to deploy a specific chart that is not included in the standard catalog or the ArtifactHub sync list, you can import it manually.

<Steps>

1.  Click the **Import** button.
2.  In the **Import Chart** dialog, paste the direct link to the chart's `.tgz` file.
    * *Example:* `https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami/nginx-15.0.0.tgz`
3.  Click **Confirm**.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
Ensure the URL points directly to a valid tarball (`.tgz`) file. Once imported, the chart will appear in the application list and be ready for installation.

## Application Details

Clicking on an application card opens a details panel with two main tabs:

- **Description**: Full description of the application.
- **Keywords**: Tags associated with the chart.
- **Dependencies**: Lists other charts required by this application.
- **Home**: Link to the application's homepage.
- **Sources**: Links to the source code.
- **Maintainers**: List of the chart's maintainers.

### Releases

Lists the installed instances (releases) of this chart in your cluster. The table includes:

- **Name**: The name of the release.
- **Namespace**: The namespace where it is deployed.
- **Chart**: The chart version and application version.
- **Revision**: The revision number of the release.
- **Actions**: Options to manage the release (Edit, Rollback, Delete).

## Manage Applications

You can install new applications or manage existing releases directly from the Store.
