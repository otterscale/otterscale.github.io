The Store page serves as a marketplace for discovering and deploying applications to your OtterScale cluster. It leverages Helm charts to package and manage applications, providing a user-friendly interface to browse, install, and manage releases.

## Introduction

The Store page displays a catalog of available applications (Helm charts). You can browse the catalog using filters for name, keyword, maintainer, and deprecation status.

Each application card displays:

- **Icon**: The application's logo.
- **Name**: The name of the application.
- **Version**: The current version of the chart.
- **Description**: A brief description of the application.
- **Repository**: The source repository of the chart (e.g., `otterscale/`). Official OtterScale charts are marked with a "Official" badge.

## Application Details

Clicking on an application card opens a details panel with two main tabs:

### Information

Provides comprehensive details about the chart:

- **Description**: Full description of the application.
- **Keywords**: Tags associated with the chart.
- **Dependencies**: Lists other charts required by this application.
- **Home**: Link to the application's homepage.
- **Sources**: Links to the source code.
- **Maintainers**: List of the chart's maintainers.

### Releases

Lists the installed instances (releases) of this chart in your cluster. The table includes:

- **Name**: The name of the release.
- **Namespace**: The namespace where it is deployed.
- **Chart**: The chart version and application version.
- **Revision**: The revision number of the release.
- **Actions**: Options to manage the release (Edit, Rollback, Delete).

## Manage Applications

You can install new applications or manage existing releases directly from the Store.

### Install an Application

To deploy a new application:

<Steps>

1.  Click on the application card to open the details panel.
2.  Click the **Install** button.
3.  **Configuration**:

    - **Name**: Enter a name for the release.
    - **Namespace**: Specify the target namespace.
    - **Version**: Select the chart version to install.
    - **Dry Run**: Toggle to simulate the installation without making changes.
    - **Configuration**: Customize the `values.yaml` configuration for the chart. You can modify the parameters to override the chart's defaults, such as replica counts, resource limits, or service settings. The editor supports YAML syntax highlighting and validation.

      ```yaml
      # Example Configuration
      replicaCount: 1
      image:
        repository: nginx
        tag: stable
      service:
        type: ClusterIP
        port: 80
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
      ```

4.  Click **Confirm** to start the installation. Once installed, the application will appear in the **Releases** tab.

</Steps>

### Manage Releases

For existing releases listed in the **Releases** tab, you can perform the following actions:

- **Edit**: Update the release configuration (e.g., change values or upgrade version).
- **Rollback**: Revert the release to a previous revision.
- **Delete**: Uninstall the release from the cluster.
