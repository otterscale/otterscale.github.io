The Extensions page allows you to manage the add-ons and system components that extend the functionality of your OtterScale cluster. Extensions are grouped into bundles based on their purpose, such as General, Model, Registry, Virtual Machine, and Storage.

## Overview

Extensions are essential components that enable specific features within the platform. The Extensions page organizes these components into expandable bundles. Each bundle displays a progress bar indicating the installation status of the extensions within it.

### Extension Bundles

The available extension bundles include:
