The Built-in Test page allows you to run performance benchmarks on your storage infrastructure. It provides tools to validate the performance of block storage (using FIO) and object storage (using Warp).

## Introduction

The page is divided into two main sections:

- **IO Test**: Benchmarks disk I/O performance using the Flexible I/O tester (FIO). This is useful for testing Ceph block devices or NFS shares.
- **Object Storage Test**: Benchmarks S3-compatible object storage performance using MinIO Warp. This supports testing internal (Ceph, MinIO) and external S3 endpoints.

## IO Test (FIO)

FIO (Flexible I/O tester) is a standard tool for benchmarking disk I/O. You can use it to simulate specific workload patterns and measure the performance of your storage backend.

### Run an IO Test

To start a new IO benchmark:

<Steps>

1.  Navigate to the **IO Test** tab.
2.  Click the **Create** button.
3.  Configure the test parameters:
    - **Target**: Select the storage target (e.g., Ceph Block Pool or NFS).
    - **Access Mode**: Choose the I/O pattern (Read, Write, Random Read, Random Write, etc.).
    - **Block Size**: Set the size of I/O units (e.g., 4k, 64k).
    - **IO Depth**: Define the queue depth for asynchronous I/O.
    - **Run Time**: Set the duration of the test.
4.  Click **Confirm** to start the test.

</Steps>

### Understanding Results

Once the test completes, the results table displays key metrics:

- **IOPS**: Input/Output Operations Per Second. Higher is better for transactional workloads.
- **Bandwidth**: Data transfer rate (MB/s). Higher is better for streaming workloads.
- **Latency**: The time taken to complete an I/O request (Min, Max, Mean). Lower is better.

## Object Storage Test (Warp)

Warp is a high-performance S3 benchmarking tool. It is designed to measure the throughput and latency of object storage services.

### Run an Object Storage Test

To start a new Object Storage benchmark:

<Steps>

1.  Navigate to the **Object Storage Test** tab.
2.  Click the **Create** button.
3.  Configure the test parameters:
    - **Target**: Select an internal service (Ceph, MinIO) or configure an external S3 endpoint (Host, Access Key, Secret Key).
    - **Operation**: Choose the operation to test (PUT, GET, DELETE, etc.).
    - **Object Size**: Set the size of the objects used in the test.
    - **Duration**: Set the duration of the benchmark.
    - **Concurrency**: (Optional) Adjust the number of concurrent operations.
4.  Click **Confirm** to start the test.

</Steps>

### Understanding Results

The results table provides insights into the object storage performance:

- **Throughput**: The speed of data transfer (Fastest, Median, Slowest).
- **Operations**: The rate of object operations (OPS).
- **Total Transferred**: The total amount of data and number of objects processed during the test.
