The OSD (Object Storage Daemon) page provides a comprehensive view of the storage daemons that manage data within your Ceph cluster. It allows you to monitor the health, performance, and usage of each OSD.

## Introduction

The OSD page displays a list of all Object Storage Daemons. The table includes the following information:

| Column           | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**         | The unique identifier of the OSD (e.g., `osd.0`).                                                                                                 |
| **State**        | The current status of the OSD. `Up` indicates the daemon is running and reachable. `In` indicates the OSD is in the cluster map and storing data. |
| **Exists**       | Indicates whether the OSD physically exists and is recognized by the cluster.                                                                     |
| **Device Class** | The type of storage medium used by the OSD (e.g., `hdd`, `ssd`, `nvme`).                                                                          |
| **Machine**      | The hostname of the physical machine hosting the OSD. Clicking the hostname navigates to the machine's details page.                              |
| **PG Count**     | The number of Placement Groups (PGs) hosted on this OSD.                                                                                          |
| **Usage**        | A progress bar showing the storage capacity usage (Used Space / Total Space).                                                                     |
| **IOPS**         | A real-time chart displaying the Input/Output Operations Per Second (Input vs. Output).                                                           |
| **Throughput**   | A real-time chart displaying the data transfer rate (Read vs. Write).                                                                             |
