import { Steps, Aside, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The OSD (Object Storage Daemon) page provides a detailed overview of the storage daemons in your Ceph cluster.  
Each OSD represents a logical disk that maps to an underlying physical device such as NVMe, SSD, or HDD.

### Statistics Overview

At the top of the page, you will find a dashboard summarizing the state of OSD capacity and availability across the cluster:

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Count" icon="">
		The total number of OSDs detected by the cluster.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Usage" icon="">
		The percentage of overall raw storage usage across all OSDs.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Introduction

The OSD page lists all Object Storage Daemons currently available in the cluster.
Each row represents one OSD instance and includes the following information:

| Column              | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**            | The unique identifier of the OSD (e.g., `osd.0`).                                                                                                 |
| **State**           | Indicates the operational status. **Up** means the daemon is running. **In** means the OSD is included in the CRUSH map and is storing data.      |
| **Exists**          | Shows whether the OSD physically exists and is recognized by the cluster.                                                                         |
| **Device Class**    | The storage device type assigned to the OSD, such as `hdd`, `ssd`, or `nvme`. This information helps determine data placement and CRUSH behavior. |
| **Machine**         | The hostname of the node hosting the OSD. Selecting the hostname opens the machine detail page.                                                   |
| **Placement Group** | The number of Placement Groups (PGs) currently assigned to the OSD.                                                                               |
| **Usage**           | A visual indicator showing the used and total storage capacity of the OSD (Used Space / Total Space).                                             |
| **IOPS**            | A real-time chart showing input and output operations per second (Input vs. Output).                                                              |
| **Throughput**      | A real-time chart showing read and write data throughput (Read vs. Write).                                                                        |

## Manage OSDs

Each OSD provides an Actions menu for administrative operations.

#### View SMART

Retrieves S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) information from the physical disk associated with the OSD.  
This data helps assess hardware health and identify potential failures.

<Steps>

1.  Open the Actions menu for the selected OSD.
2.  Click **Do S.M.A.R.T.** 
3.  A dialog will appear showing the full S.M.A.R.T. report for the device.
