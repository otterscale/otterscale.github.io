The Pool page allows you to manage Ceph storage pools, which are logical partitions for storing objects. Pools provide a layer of abstraction between clients and the underlying OSDs, allowing you to configure data durability, availability, and performance policies.

### Statistics Overview

At the top of the page, you will find a dashboard summarizing the state of pool configuration within the cluster:

		The total number of storage pools currently defined in the system.

</CardGrid>

## Introduction

The Pool page displays a list of all storage pools. The table includes the following information:

| Column           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**         | The name of the pool. A spinner icon indicates if the pool is currently updating.                                                                                                                     |
| **Type**         | The type of the pool, either `Replicated` (copies data) or `Erasure` (uses erasure coding for efficiency). It also displays configuration details like replica count or erasure coding profile (k+m). |
| **Applications** | The applications enabled for this pool (e.g., `rbd`, `cephfs`, `rgw`).                                                                                                                                |
| **PG State**     | The state of the Placement Groups (PGs) within the pool (e.g., `active`, `clean`, `degraded`).                                                                                                        |
| **Usage**        | A progress bar indicating the amount of data stored in the pool relative to its total logical capacity.                                                                                               |

## Create Pool

You can create new storage pools to meet specific application requirements.
The create dialog includes configuration fields for pool type, replica size or erasure coding settings, application assignment, and optional quotas.

<Steps>

1.  Click the **Create** button.
2.  **Name**: Enter a unique name for the pool.
3.  **Type**: Select the pool type:
    - **Replicated**: Stores multiple copies of data. Ideal for high performance and fast recovery.
      - **Replicated Size**: Specify the number of replicas (e.g., 3).
    - **Erasure**: Uses erasure coding to save space. Ideal for cold storage or large datasets.
      - **EC Overwrite**: Enable if you need to support overwrites (required for RBD/CephFS on EC pools).
4.  **Quota**: Optionally set limits on the pool's usage:
    - **Max Bytes**: The maximum amount of data (in GB or TB) the pool can store.
5.  **Advanced Settings (Optional)**:
    - **Max Objects**: The maximum number of objects the pool can store.
6.  Click **Confirm** to create the pool.

</Steps>

## Manage Pools

You can modify or delete existing pools using the **Actions** menu.

### Edit Pool

Allows you to modify the pool's configuration, such as quotas.

<Steps>

1.  Select **Edit** from the actions menu (pencil icon).
2.  Update the **Quota Size**, or **Quota Objects** as needed.
3.  Click **Confirm** to save changes.

</Steps>

### Delete Pool

Permanently removes a storage pool and all its data.

<Steps>

1.  Select **Delete** from the actions menu (trash icon).
2.  Type the name of the pool to confirm deletion.
3.  Click **Confirm** to permanently delete the pool.

</Steps>

	Deleting a pool is irreversible. Ensure that no applications are currently using the pool and that
	you have backed up any critical data.
