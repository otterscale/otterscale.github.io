The Block Device page allows you to manage Ceph RADOS Block Devices (RBD). RBDs are block-based storage devices that are striped across the cluster, providing high-performance and reliable storage for virtual machines, containers, and other applications.

## Overview

At the top of the page, providing a quick overview of RBD usage in the cluster.

### Images
Shows the total number of RADOS Block Device images currently stored across all pools.

### Usage
Displays the combined usage of all block device images.  
Including the total used capacity and total provisioned quota, helping administrators assess storage consumption at a glance.

## Introduction

The Block Device page displays a list of all RBD images. The table includes the following information:

| Column        | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**      | The name of the block device image.                                                                                                              |
| **Pool Name** | The storage pool where the image is stored.                                                                                                      |
| **Usage**     | A progress bar showing the storage capacity usage (Used Space / Quota Size).                                                                     |
| **Snapshots** | The number of snapshots taken of this block device. Clicking the external link icon opens a detailed view of the [snapshots](#manage-snapshots). |

## Create Block Device

You can create new block devices to provide storage for your applications.

<Steps>

1.  Click the **Create** button.
2.  **Image Name**: Enter a unique name for the block device.
3.  **Pool Name**: Select the storage pool to host the image.
4.  **Quota Size**: Specify the size of the block device (e.g., 100 GB).
5.  **Advanced Settings** (Optional):
    - **Striping**: Configure **Object Size**, **Stripe Unit**, and **Stripe Count** to optimize performance for specific workloads.
    - **Features**: Enable or disable RBD features like **Layering**, **Exclusive Lock**, **Object Map**, **Fast Diff**, and **Deep Flatten**.
6.  Click **Confirm** to create the block device.

</Steps>

## Manage Block Devices

You can modify or delete existing block devices using the **Actions** menu.

### Edit Block Device

Allows you to expand or shrink the block device.

	Shrinking is irreversible. Ensure that you have backed up any critical data.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1.  Select **Edit** from the actions menu (pencil icon).
2.  Update the **Quota Size** to increase the device size.
3.  Click **Confirm** to save changes.

</Steps>

### Delete Block Device

Permanently removes a block device and all its data.

<Steps>

1.  Select **Delete** from the actions menu (trash icon).
2.  Type the name of the image to confirm deletion.
3.  Click **Confirm** to permanently delete the block device.

</Steps>

<Aside type="danger">
	Deleting a block device is irreversible. Ensure that the device is not mounted or in use by any
	application and that you have backed up any critical data.
</Aside>

## Manage Snapshots

Snapshots provide a read-only copy of the block device state at a specific point in time. You can view and manage snapshots by clicking the external link icon in the **Snapshots** column.

### Snapshot List

The snapshot list displays the following information:

| Column      | Description                                                                     |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**    | The name of the snapshot.                                                       |
| **Protect** | Indicates whether the snapshot is protected from deletion.                      |
| **Usage**   | A progress bar showing the storage usage of the snapshot.                       |

### Snapshot Actions

The **Actions** menu for each snapshot provides the following options:

- **Rollback**: Reverts the block device to the state captured in the snapshot. **Note**: This will discard any changes made since the snapshot was taken.
- **Protect**: Prevents the snapshot from being deleted. Useful for critical backups.
- **Unprotect**: Removes the protection, allowing the snapshot to be deleted.
- **Delete**: Permanently removes the snapshot.
