import { Steps, Aside, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The File System page allows you to manage Ceph File Systems (CephFS) and Network File System (NFS) exports. CephFS provides a POSIX-compliant file system on top of the Ceph cluster, while NFS exports allow you to share these file systems with standard NFS clients.

The page is divided into two main sections: **NFS** and **Group**.

## NFS

The NFS section allows you to manage subvolumes and export them via NFS.

### Statistics Overview

At the top of the page, you will find a dashboard summarizing the state of NFS exports configured in the system:

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="NFS" icon="">
		The total number of NFS exports created from CephFS subvolumes.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

### Introduction

The NFS table displays a list of subvolumes. The table includes the following information:

| Column           | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**         | The name of the subvolume.                                                                                                                 |
| **Pool Name**    | The data pool where the subvolume is stored.                                                                                               |
| **Export**       | Displays the NFS export path and allowed clients (IPs). Clicking the copy icon copies the mount command.                                   |
| **Usage**        | A progress bar showing the storage capacity usage (Used Space / Quota Size).                                                               |
| **Created Time** | The creation timestamp of the subvolume.                                                                                                   |
| **Snapshots**    | The number of snapshots taken of this subvolume. Clicking the external link icon opens a detailed view of the [snapshots](#snapshot-list). |

### Create NFS Export

You can create new subvolumes and export them via NFS.

<Steps>

1.  Click the **Create** button.
2.  **Name**: Enter a unique name for the subvolume.
3.  **Group**: Displays the current subvolume group (default is `default`).
4.  **Quota Size**: Specify the size limit for the subvolume (e.g., 10 GB).
5.  Click **Confirm** to create the subvolume.

</Steps>

### Manage NFS Exports

You can manage access, modify quotas, or delete NFS exports using the **Actions** menu.

#### Grant/Revoke Access

Control which clients can access the NFS export.

- **Grant Access**: Adds a client IP address to the allowed list.
- **Revoke Access**: Removes a client IP address from the allowed list.

#### Edit NFS Export

Allows you to resize the subvolume quota.

<Steps>

1.  Select **Edit** from the actions menu (pencil icon).
2.  Update the **Quota Size**.
3.  Click **Confirm** to save changes.

</Steps>

#### Delete NFS Export

Permanently removes the subvolume and its export.

<Steps>

1.  Select **Delete** from the actions menu (trash icon).
2.  Type the name of the subvolume to confirm deletion.
3.  Click **Confirm** to permanently delete the subvolume.

</Steps>

<Aside type="danger">
	Deleting a NFS export is irreversible. Ensure that you have backed up any critical data.
</Aside>

### Manage Snapshots

Snapshots provide a read-only copy of the subvolume at a specific point in time. You can view and manage snapshots by clicking the external link icon in the **Snapshots** column.

#### Snapshot List

The snapshot list displays the following information:

| Column             | Description                                                       |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**           | The name of the snapshot.                                         |
| **Pending Clones** | Indicates if there are any pending clones based on this snapshot. |
| **Created Time**   | The creation timestamp of the snapshot.                           |

#### Snapshot Actions

- **Delete**: Permanently removes the snapshot.

## Group

The Group section allows you to manage subvolume groups, which are used to organize subvolumes.

### Statistics Overview

At the top of the page, you will find a dashboard summarizing the state of subvolume groups configured in the file system:

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Group" icon="">
		The total number of subvolume groups defined in the file system.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

### Introduction

The Group table displays a list of subvolume groups. The table includes the following information:

| Column           | Description                                                                 |
