import { Steps, Aside, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Object page allows you to manage the Ceph Object Gateway (RGW), which provides an S3-compatible object storage interface. You can manage buckets for storing objects and users for controlling access.

The page is divided into two main sections: **Bucket** and **User**.

## Bucket

The Bucket section allows you to manage S3 buckets.

### Statistics Overview

At the top of the page, you will find a dashboard summarizing the state of S3 storage:

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Bucket" icon="tabler:bucket">
		The total number of S3 buckets currently defined in the system. 

		The RGW endpoint IP that clients use to access the bucket via S3-compatible APIs.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Usage" icon="tabler:chart-pie">
		The combined storage consumption across all buckets, including object data and metadata overhead.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

### Access Bucket with S3 Browser

This section demonstrates how to access a Ceph Object Gateway (RGW) bucket using S3 Browser, a graphical S3 client.
This approach is useful for manual verification, browsing objects, and basic upload/download operations without writing code.

#### Prerequisites

<Steps>

1. Create a user in User section.
2. Create an access key for the user and copy the secret key.
3. Create a bucket and assign the user as the owner. The bucket owner always has full control of the bucket regardless of the selected ACL.
4. Open S3 Browser.
5. Fill in the account settings:
	- Account type: S3 compatible storage
	- API endpoint: RGW endpoint
	- Access Key ID: User’s access key.
	- Secret Access Key:  The copied secret key.
	- Use secure transfer: Disable SSL
6. Add new account

</Steps>
